# Load GeneralizedSasakiNakamura for the extended suite and bind it to `GSN`.
#
# * Without GSN_SOURCE: `using GeneralizedSasakiNakamura` from the active environment (Pkg.test or any
#   environment that has the package).
# * With GSN_SOURCE=<checkout or private tree>: include "$GSN_SOURCE/src/GeneralizedSasakiNakamura.jl" the way
#   local include workflow does. GSN_SWSH_PATH optionally selects a dependency checkout.
#
# Included at top level of Main by runtests.jl, and by each group file when that file is run on its own.
